# 📘 Credit Health Intelligence Engine: Governance & Best Practices

---

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

> ✨ *"Govern with clarity. Document with precision. Change with purpose. Execute with accountability."*

---

## 🔹 1. Change Management Framework

### Version Control
* 🔄 **Semantic Versioning**: Follow `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for all changes
* 📝 **Changelog**: Maintain `CHANGELOG.md` with all notable changes
* 🔗 **Linking**: Reference related issues/PRs in commit messages

### Change Process
1. **Proposal**: Document changes in a GitHub Issue or ADR (Architectural Decision Record)
2. **Review**: Require at least one peer review for all code changes
3. **Testing**: All changes must include appropriate test coverage
4. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation before merging
5. **Approval**: Designated code owners must approve sensitive changes

### Rollback Plan
* Maintain backward compatibility where possible
* Document rollback procedures for all deployments
* Use feature flags for major changes

---

## 🔹 2. Data Governance

### Data Quality Standards
* ✅ **Validation Rules**: Enforce data validation at all pipeline stages
* 🔍 **Quality Metrics**: Track completeness, accuracy, and timeliness
* 🛡 **Sensitive Data**: Follow PII handling guidelines (mask, encrypt, log access)

### Repayment Score Calculation Standards

#### 1. Core Calculation Components

| Metric | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Total Repayment Amount | 25% | Sum of all repayments made by the agent |
| Total Principal Repaid | 20% | Sum of principal amounts repaid |
| Number of Repayment Transactions | 15% | Count of repayment transactions |
| Average Repayment Per Transaction | 15% | Mean repayment amount per transaction |
| Average Principal Per Transaction | 10% | Mean principal amount per transaction |
| Principal-to-Total Repayment Ratio | 15% | Ratio of principal to total repayment amount |

#### 2. Normalization Process
- Each metric is normalized to a 0-1 scale using min-max scaling
- Formula: 
  ```
  X_norm = (X - X_min) / (X_max - X_min)
  ```
- Special handling for division by zero cases

#### 3. Final Score Calculation
- Weighted sum of normalized metrics
- Final score scaled to 0-100 range
- Rounded to 2 decimal places for consistency

#### 4. Implementation Requirements
- Must be recalculated daily
- Historical scores must be preserved for trend analysis
- All calculations must be logged for audit purposes
- Changes to weights require approval via ADR (Architectural Decision Record)

### Data Lineage
* Document all data sources and transformations
* Maintain data dictionary with field definitions and business rules
* Track data ownership and stewardship

### Retention Policies
* Transaction Data: 7 years
* Logs: 90 days (1 year for security logs)
* Backups: 30-day rotation

---

## 🔹 3. Documentation Standards

### Living Documentation
* Keep documentation in `docs/` directory
* Use Markdown with consistent formatting
* Include examples and sample outputs
* Document assumptions and limitations

### Required Documentation
- `AGENT_CLASSIFICATION.md`: Agent tiering criteria and thresholds
- `FEATURE_ENGINEERING_DOCS.md`: Data processing and feature creation
- `DATA_DICTIONARY.md`: Schema definitions and relationships
- `ONBOARDING.md`: Setup and configuration guide

---

## 🔹 4. Risk Management

### Risk Assessment
* Classify risks by impact (Low/Medium/High) and likelihood
* Document mitigation strategies
* Review risks quarterly

### Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
1. Data Quality Score < 95%
2. Model Drift > 5%
3. Processing Latency > 1 hour
4. Failed Jobs > 0

### Incident Response
* Document all incidents in the incident log
* Conduct post-mortems for major incidents
* Track remediation actions

---

## 🔹 5. Compliance & Auditing

### Regulatory Requirements
* Document all compliance requirements
* Maintain evidence of compliance
* Conduct annual compliance reviews

### Audit Trail
* Log all data access and modifications
* Retain audit logs for 7 years
* Regular access reviews

---

## 🔹 6. Modular by Default

* 🧩 Break down complex processes into reusable modules
* ❌ Avoid monolithic scripts—organize logic across clearly named files
* 📂 Maintain a clean directory structure (`/utils`, `/output`, `/models`, etc.)

---

## 🔹 7. Monitoring & Alerting

### System Health
* Monitor pipeline status and data freshness
* Set up alerts for failures and anomalies
* Track performance metrics

### Business Metrics
* Agent classification distribution
* Risk exposure by region
* Model performance metrics

---

## 🔹 8. Lean Code, Always

* 🔁 **Reuse** existing functions/scripts wherever possible
* ❌ Avoid rewriting or duplicating logic unless **absolutely necessary**
* 🧼 Keep functions small and focused on one task
* 🧠 Think: *“Can I solve this with what already exists?”*

---

## 🔹 9. Respect the Base

* ⚖️ If a core script exists (e.g., `feature_engineering.py`), use it
* �� Don’t overwrite or fork the base unless:
  * a major refactor is **justified**, and
  * legacy compatibility is handled

---

## 🔹 10. Governance Committee

### Responsibilities
* Review and approve policy changes
* Monitor compliance with standards
* Resolve cross-functional issues

### Membership
* Data Owner
* Engineering Lead
* Risk Manager
* Compliance Officer
* Business Stakeholders

---

## ✅ TL;DR — *Golden Rules for LLMs*

```
1. Don’t duplicate – reuse modules unless change is justified.
2. Keep code modular, lean, and traceable.
3. Structure outputs and logs consistently.
4. Write for humans — clear, readable, intentional code.
5. Default to simplicity. Scale with structure, not shortcuts.
```
